# Seeds Analysis

## Overview

The **Seeds Analysis** project involves analyzing seed data to explore patterns, classify seed types, and provide insights into their properties. This project is ideal for agriculture research, quality control, or understanding seed characteristics using statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Objectives

- Perform data preprocessing to clean and prepare seed data for analysis.
- Explore seed characteristics through statistical and visual methods.
- Build classification models to identify seed types based on input features.
- Provide visualizations to summarize findings and model results.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncover trends, correlations, and distributions in seed data.
- **Classification Models:** Develop and evaluate models like logistic regression, decision trees, or SVM to classify seed types.
- **Visualization:** Create meaningful charts and graphs to present results.
- **Feature Engineering:** Identify important features that influence seed classification.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Manipulation:** pandas, numpy
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing seed characteristics, which may include:
- Seed type (as the target variable)
- Physical properties such as length, width, compactness, or area
- Any other relevant features

[Include details about the dataset's source or a link to download it.]

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JanviRattanAtre/Seeds-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Seeds-Analysis
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the analysis:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
     Then open the analysis notebook (e.g., `seeds_analysis.ipynb`) and run the cells sequentially.
   - Alternatively, if a script is available (e.g., `main.py`):
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

## Results

The project outputs include:
- Statistical summaries and visual insights into seed characteristics.
- Performance metrics for classification models (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
- Feature importance analysis to identify key contributors to classification.

## Use Cases

- **Agriculture Research:** Study seed properties to enhance crop production.
- **Quality Control:** Classify and verify seed types for industrial applications.
- **Data Science Education:** Use the project as a case study for machine learning applications.
